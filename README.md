# factory-shop-gh-pages

There is a website to publish via Github Pages. The site is available at [https://natural-coding.github.io/factory-shop](https://natural-coding.github.io/factory-shop)

It is an example of a static website for an imaginary local shop. You can buy food, the stuff for house remodeling and a lot of things here. 

The website was created using CSS, HTML and JavaScript. No bundlers were used. There are a lot custom SVG images under the hood. Hope they create a good user experience.

The UI is fully responsive. It fits desktop, tablet and mobile devices' screens.

I would rather use Parcel.js and SASS for such kind of work today! :-)
